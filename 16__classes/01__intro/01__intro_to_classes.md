## Why do we need classes?
* Ruby's built-in objets like Arrays or Hashes cannot represent everything. What if we need to represent Users, Cars or Invoices?
* The goal of object-oriented design is to use code to model real-life things as classes
* An object is a custom container for data
* Objects group functionalities into a single unit

## Objects attributes and methods
* Instance variables (attributes) are variables that belong to the object
* Attributes provide information about the object's current state
* Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object
* Encapsulation is an OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object

## Classes and Objects
* A class is the blueprint, pattern, template or outline for an object
* An object is an instance of the class. It is created from the class
* Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class
* A class is called an abstract type because it hides the complexity of interacting with the data, such like a method abstracts the complexity of a process
