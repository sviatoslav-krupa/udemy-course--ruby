# Access and Work with the Terminal
[Here](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/learn/lecture/6477424#overview) is the link to the video.

## Useful terminal commands:
* `$ pwd` - **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory
* `$ ls` - allows to list all files or directories in the current directory
* `$ cd <directory name>` - navigates to the directory
* `$ cd ..` - navigates up one directory level
* `$ mkdir` - **m**a**k**es **dir**ectory
* `$ clear` - **clear**s terminal tab
* `$ touch <filename>` - creates an empty file
* `$ open <filename>` - opens file
> We can add options to the command by appending a flag, e.g. `$ git --version`

## Notes
* `.bash-profile` - runs when terminal starting
*  **PATH** is a collection of folders/directories where your command-line application (like Terminal or PowerShell) looks for software.
