# Interactive Ruby (IRB)

## What is an IRB:
* Automatically installed with ruby
* Sandbox, playground
* It's a REPL: **r**ead -> **e**valuate -> **p**rint -> **l**oop
* Open by `$ irb`
* Returned value indicates with `=>` (rocket)
* Exit by `> quit` or `> exit`
* Once you closed IRB, all work is gone

## Notes:
* `$ irb` is not the same as `$ ruby`
