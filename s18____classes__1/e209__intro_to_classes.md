# Intro to Classes

## Why do we need classes?
* Ruby's built-in objets like Arrays or Hashes cannot represent everything.
* What if we need to represent Users, Cars or Invoices?
* The goal of object-oriented design is to use code to model real-life things as classes.
* An object is a custom container for data.
* Objects group functionalities into a single unit.

## Objects attributes and methods:
* Instance variables (attributes) are variables that belong to the object.
* Attributes provide information about the object's current state.
* Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object.
* Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object.

## Classes and Objects
* A class is the blueprint, pattern, template or outline for an object.
* An object is an instance of the class. It is created from the class.
* Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class.
* A class is called an abstract type because it hides the complexity of interacting with the data, much like a method abstracts the complexity of a process.
