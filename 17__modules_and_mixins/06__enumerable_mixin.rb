# What is a mixin?
#   * A mixin is a module that injects additional behaviour into a class
#   * Mixins allow us to mimic inheritance from more than one class
#   * A class that includes a module has access to its methods and constants
#   * Constants and methods mixed into a class do not need to be prefixed with the module name

# Modules (Mixins) vs Inheritance:
#   * Class inheritance should be used for an "is-a" relationship
#     E.g., Array is a type fo Object, Integer is a type of Numeric
#   * Modules should be used for a "has-a" relationship
#     E.g., String has a Comparable feature set

# The method lookup path (.ancestors method shows a full path):
#   1. Modules included with :prepend keyword
#   2. Class definition
#   3. Included modules (the order that modules are included in class matters)
#     First of all, Ruby looks at the last module included in the class
#     If multiple modules mix in methods with the same name, the last modules included in the class will be used first
#   4. Parent classes
#   5. Ruby will throw an error if the method is not found in the class, the modules or any superclasses (:method_missing)

# Why mix in modules to classes?
#   * Different classes need similar functionalities
#     E.g. String and Numeric both need `<`, `>`, `==`, ...
#     Neither class can be represented as a subclass of the other
#   * Duplication of methods across classes violates the DRY principle
