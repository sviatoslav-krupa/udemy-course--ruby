# Create Hash with Default Value

# Literal syntax
fruit_prices = { banana: 1.05 }
fruit_prices[:banana] # => 1.05
fruit_prices[:orange] # => nil

fruit_prices = Hash.new("Not found") # parameter is a default value
fruit_prices[:banana] = 1.05
fruit_prices[:banana] # => 1.05
fruit_prices[:orange] # => "Not found"

# .default (https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.3/Hash.html#method-i-default)
fruit_prices.default = "Whoops! That doesn't exists here!"
fruit_prices.default # => "Whoops! That doesn't exists here!"
fruit_prices[:banana] # => 1.05
fruit_prices[:orange] # => "Whoops! That doesn't exists here!"

# Edge case
test_hash = Hash.new("Not found")
test_hash.default # => "Not found"
test_hash[:test] # => "Not found"

test_hash.default = "404"
test_hash.default # => "404"
test_hash[:test] # => "404"


# Reference problem with Hash.new

first_team_members = Hash.new([]) # default value is the same object for all non-existing keys

first_team_members # => {}
first_team_members["Buccaneers"] # => [] (hash isn't modified yet)

first_team_members["Buccaneers"] << "Tom Brady"

first_team_members # => {} (hash still isn't modified yet, we just modified the default value)
first_team_members["Buccaneers"] # => ["Tom Brady"]
first_team_members["Patriots"] # => ["Tom Brady"]

# Run the block each time we access a non-existing key and return block evaluation value as a default one
second_team_members = Hash.new do |hash, key|
  # Here we can just return `[]` so all non-existing keys will have `[]` value (each time different object)
  # But this approach will not modify an initial hash
  hash[key] = []
end

second_team_members["Buccaneers"] # => [] (modify the hash in the block)
second_team_members # => {"Buccaneers" => []}

second_team_members["Buccaneers"] << "Tom Brady"
second_team_members["Buccaneers"] # => ["Tom Brady"]
second_team_members # => {"Buccaneers" => ["Tom Brady"]}

second_team_members["Patriots"] # => []
second_team_members # => {"Buccaneers" => ["Tom Brady"], "Patriots" => []}
