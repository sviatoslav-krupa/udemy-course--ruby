# Introduction to Arrays

# Documentation (https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.3/Array.html)

# What is an array:
# * Ordered collection of objects (as a list).
# * Can contain objects with different types.
# * Itself is an object.
# * It acts as a container for other objects.
# * An array is created with a pair of square brackets `[]`.

# Notes:
# * Homogeneous array or homogeneous data - stores elements of the same data type.

p [] # => [] (empty array)
p [].class # => Array
