# Return Values and the nil Object
# Here (https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/learn/lecture/6477582#overview) is the link to the video.

# Notes
# * Every expression in Ruby returns something (return is the final output, result)
# * nil represents nothing, emptiness or blankness, absence of a value

puts 5 + 2 # => nil (prints 7)
print nil # => nil (prints nothing)
puts nil # => nil (prints only line break)
p nil # => nil (prints `nil`)
